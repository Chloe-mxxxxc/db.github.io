## Introduction
In the realm of historical manuscript research, scholars have devoted immeasurable hours to the meticulous identification and documentation of symbols within ancient texts. 
Although much of the prior research in computer vision has prioritized few-shot/one-shot/open-set object detection, there's an omission in studies centered on the detection of unseen texts. 
Consequently, we introduce this aspect in this section. The current methodology, vital for comprehending historical and cultural evolution, is predominantly manual and labor-intensive. 
Constrained by resources, researchers manually decipher new symbols, carefully record their observations, and then systematically catalog these symbols. 
Figure 1 exemplifies the arduous process a scholar undergoes when documenting insights from Dongba manuscripts ('Dongba Hieroglyphics', one of the ancient hieroglyphic scripts affiliated with China, was invented by the ancestors of the Naxi minority in China).  
While comprehensive, this approach is prone to inefficiencies, potential misinterpretations, and inaccuracies due to human factors.
