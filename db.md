## Introduction

Based on the Dongba Single Character Dataset, we have created the Dongba Natural Scene Synthetic Dataset, which includes images of Dongba characters on a white canvas and images of Dongba characters in natural scenes. 

Figure 1 shows an image of Dongba characters on a white canvas, while Figure 2 displays Dongba characters within a natural setting. 

Each image randomly encompasses 1-10 Dongba characters. The dataset comprises 40,000 images in the training set, 4,000 in the validation set, and 4,000 in the test set.
