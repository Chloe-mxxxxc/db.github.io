## Introduction

Based on the Dongba Single Character Dataset, we have created the Dongba Natural Scene Synthetic Dataset, which includes images of Dongba characters on a white canvas and images of Dongba characters in natural scenes. For example, Figure 1 shows an image of Dongba characters on a white canvas, while Figure 2 displays Dongba characters within a natural setting. Each image randomly encompasses 1-10 Dongba characters. The dataset comprises 40,000 images in the training set, 4,000 in the validation set, and 4,000 in the test set.

Table 1 presents the detailed specifics of the dataset.

| Train            | White canvas      | Natural scene |
|:-----------------|:------------------|:--------------|
| Number of Images | 20,000            | 20,000        |

| Val              | White canvas      | Natural scene |
|:-----------------|:------------------|:--------------|
| Number of Images | 20,00             | 20,00         |

| Test             | White canvas      | Natural scene |
|:-----------------|:------------------|:--------------|
| Number of Images | 20,00             | 20,00         |


Based on "A Dictionary of Dongba Pictographs and Phonetic Scripts," we have created a dataset of individual Dongba characters, offering Dongba-to-Chinese translations. 

This effort aims to provide the most straightforward and clear digital outcomes, facilitating future research. Our studies have found that Dongba symbols vary among different Naxi communities; the over 2,000 characters summarized in "A Dictionary of Dongba Pictographs and Phonetic Scripts" represent just a fraction of the spectrum. 

We plan to expand upon this data, offering a more extensive and comprehensive digital dictionary of Dongba characters in the future.
